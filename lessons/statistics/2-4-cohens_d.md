[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

The high income effect had a somewhat trivial impact on parity (since the abs. value of the cohen's d, -0.125, is less than 0.2). While this is statistically significant, it is likely not significant enough to tell a story to medical professionals nor the average family. We also would not use this dataset to answer this question since the respondents were at different stages in their life (for example, some may not be done having babies while others are).
