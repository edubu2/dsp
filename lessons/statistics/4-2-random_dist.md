[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

## Exercise 4.2: The numbers generated by `numpy.random.random` are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

### Part 1: Generate 1000 numbers from `numpy.random.random` and plot their PMF.  What goes wrong?

The below figure is the resulting plot. It looks like this because the probability of each number being generated is the exact same.

### Part 2: Now plot the CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

Yes, the distribution is uniform.
